# App Builder - Task ShareVolume

## Overview
This application was automatically generated for task ShareVolume, round 1.

**Brief:** Your assigned company: Bunge Global (BG), CIK 0001144519.

Fetch https://data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/companyconcept/CIK0001144519/dei/EntityCommonStockSharesOutstanding.json (set a descriptive User-Agent per SEC guidance).
Read `.entityName`. Filter `.units.shares[]` for entries whose `fy` > "2020" and
includes a numeric `val`.
Save `data.json` with this structure:
`{"entityName": "Bunge Global", "max": {"val": ..., "fy": ...}, "min": {"val": ..., "fy": ...}}`
where `max` and `min` refer to the highest and lowest `.val`. Break ties however you like.

Render a visually appealing `index.html` where:
- `<title>` and `<h1>` must include the live `entityName`.
- The max/min figures are clearly marked with these IDs:
  `share-entity-name`,
  `share-max-value`, `share-max-fy`,
  `share-min-value`, `share-min-fy`.

If the page is opened as `index.html?CIK=0001018724` (or any other 10-digit CIK),
`fetch()` from the SEC endpoint for that CIK using any proxy, e.g. AIPipe,
replace every ID listed above and the title and H1 without reloading the page.

Also commit the attachment uid.txt as-is.
